# About
Robots and Autonomous Vehicles are the future. It can solve the work force shortage problems, increase safety and efficiency of many processes, and can support people in their jobs. 
I am specialized to model autonomous machines and to implement perception technology for detection, classification, prediction, and decision making purposes. For my Bachelor's thesis, together in a team, we developed a small self-driving RC-vehicle. 
For my Master thesis, I investigated Motion Prediction methods using Deep Learning. I want to develop these interests and skills in my future career, where I seek to contribute to a sustainable society that deploys robotics and AI responsibly.

Another passion of mine is to contribute to education. I am a co-creator of the Master Robotics course at the Delft University of Technology, where I contributed to the curriculum, setup, and accreditation process of the Master.
