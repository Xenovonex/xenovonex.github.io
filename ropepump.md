A SolidWorks model of the ropepump.

## Goal
Design and build a bicycle powered waterpump that can pump up 130L of water to a height of 0.75m within 5 minutes.

## Team
S. Bonhof, E. van Leeuwen, J. Linssen, S. Rademaker, J. van der Sluis, I. van Veen, Y. Verspaget, R. Dirks

## List of criteria for the pump
The pump must comply to the following demands and must be designed to meet as many of the following wishes.

#### Physical demands
* The disassembled pump must fit entirely in a box of 0.78x0.56x0.43m (130L).
* No standardized pump parts are allowed to be used.
#### Functional demands
* The 130L box must be filled with water at a height of 0.75m.
* The pump must be assembled within 10 minutes.
* The pump must be demountable.
* The pump capacity must estimated when designing the pump using fluid dynamics formulas.
#### Operational demands
* The pump must be powered by a bicycle. 
#### Production demands
* It is not allowed to adjust or change the bicycle for the pump design.
* The pump must meet CE safety criteria (no exposed threads, sharp edges, exposed chains, duct tape).
#### Financial wishes
* The cost of the pump must not be higher than â‚¬100,- unless a sponsor is willing to donate more money.
#### Functional wishes
* The 130L box must be filled within 5 minutes.
* It must be easy to (dis)assemble the pump.
#### Additional wishes
* The pump must be original and innovative.


## Process
1. A design process is initiated to make choices for the pump design. Based on five properties - pump type, bicycle-pump tranmission type, waterproofness of connection types, height transport, dissasembly method - the following design choices were made that were estimated to best meet the design criteria. 
  - A Rope pump is chosen because of its simplicity, scaling capabilities and following high flow rates.
  - A chain is used between the bicycle and pump to transmit the power.
  - A form-fitting connections for the water medium are used to prevent water leakage.
  - PVC tubes are used as water medium to transport/pump water to 0.75m high.
  - For easy disassembling of the pump, form-fitted PVC parts for the water medium and bolts and wing nuts are used for constructing the frame.
