A SolidWorks model of the ropepump.

## Goal
Design and build a bicycle powered waterpump that can pump up 130L of water to a height of 0.75m within 5 minutes.

## Team
S. Bonhof, E. van Leeuwen, J. Linssen, S. Rademaker, J. van der Sluis, I. van Veen, Y. Verspaget, R. Dirks

## List of criteria for the pump
The pump must comply to the following demands and must be designed to meet as many of the following wishes.

#### Physical demands
* The disassembled pump must fit entirely in a box of 0.78x0.56x0.43m (130L).
* No standardized pump parts are allowed to be used.

#### Functional demands
* The 130L box must be filled with water at a height of 0.75m.
* The pump must be assembled within 10 minutes.
* The pump must be demountable.
* The pump capacity must estimated when designing the pump using fluid dynamics formulas.

#### Operational demands
* The pump must be powered by a bicycle. 

#### Production demands
* It is not allowed to adjust or change the bicycle for the pump design.
* The pump must meet CE safety criteria (no exposed threads, sharp edges, exposed chains, duct tape).

#### Financial wishes
* The cost of the pump must not be higher than €100,- unless a sponsor is willing to donate more money.

#### Functional wishes
* The 130L box must be filled within 5 minutes.
* It must be easy to (dis)assemble the pump.

#### Additional wishes
* The pump must be original and innovative.


## Process
1. A design process is initiated to make choices for the pump design. Based on five properties - pump type, bicycle-pump tranmission type, waterproofness of connection types, height transport, dissasembly method - the following design choices were made that were estimated to best meet the design criteria. 
  - A Rope pump is chosen because of its simplicity, scaling capabilities and following high flow rates.
  - A chain is used between the bicycle and pump to transmit the power.
  - A form-fitting connections for the water medium are used to prevent water leakage.
  - PVC tubes are used as water medium to transport/pump water to 0.75m high.
  - For easy disassembling of the pump, form-fitted PVC parts for the water medium and bolts and wing nuts are used for constructing the frame.
2. Estimate the flow rate of a rope pump to base the design on. Formulas developed by [Smulders and Rijs (2006)](https://www.arrakis.nl/reports/060923_Ropepump_Smulders-Rijs_lr.pdf) are used to estimate the flow rate.
  * The pump flow rate is mainly dependent on: 
    - The area of the rope pump tubes.
    - The downwards velocity of the water due to gravity.
    - The upwards velocity of the rope with disks attached to it that push up the water.
    - The power transmitted from the bicycle (about 120W on average and 300W maximum by an average person).
  The flow rate was estimated on 865 L/minute, filling the box within an astounding 9 seconds, provided a design that could still fit within the 130L box when disassembled. 
3. The design measurements that lead to the estimated flow rate were used to make a sketch and a SolidWorks model of the pump. The pump consists of a frame and a water medium through which the water flows. Some design iterations are performed to ensure easy assembly of the rope pump and CE-mark safety.
4. A list of parts, assembly methods, and costs is made. The pump will cost more than €100, but we have found [Frissebronnen.nl](Frissebronnen.nl) as sponsor to donate the remaining costs. The parts are ordered.
5. The pump is assembled and tested, some minor changes are made to the design and assembly methods. The pump is ready to execute its goal.

## Results
The pump succeeds to fill up the 130L box with water within 20 seconds as can be seen in the video below. In a constest against more than 100 other pumps, this pump obtained the 3rd price for having the 3rd highest flow rate, and it obtained the 1st price for being the best pump of the rope pump category.
